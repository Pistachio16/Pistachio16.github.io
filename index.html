        <p>Name: Kevin He</p>
        <p>Biography: Hello there!! I enjoy doing activities
            that make me think and staying active.</p>
        <p>Interests: </p>

        <p>There's something really unique and interesting about a game where both players get all the information they need from
            an 8x8 board with finite rules yet infinite possibilities in which experience/intuition differentiates the best in the world.
            The middlegame is my favorite part of playing chess because it's the battleground of ideas. There's always room for 
            improvement, which excites me and motivates me.

        <p>People used their hands all the time, but how often do they use their feet? Soccer opens up an entirely new dimension
            of competition. Keeping the ball in the air using your thighs, head, and chest leaves room for creative expressions of the sport.
            Soccer taught me a lesson deeper than the sport. There's so much you can do even without your hands, so never underestimate the potential
            for your weaknesses to become your strengths.

            <p>I can <mark>cook</mark> a ham and egg taco. I can do it with <mark>speed</mark> since I want to clear time to do work in the morning. I cut my
                onions into tiny <mark>cubes</mark> using a knife. I sometimes drink the raw eggs but I don't anymore because they always drip onto my
                <mark>guitar</mark>. I wish I could cook in <mark>Minecraft</mark>, because I think I would solve world hunger. I like my eggs real <mark>gritty</mark> because 
                they taste the best like that. I'm not close to being done though, and I'm excited to share this with you using <mark>HTML</mark>!
